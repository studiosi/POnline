# POnline: a pupil annotation tool #

This tool is conceived to crowdsource pupil annotation. Part of my research on the University of Eastern Finland.

The software is free to use for academic purposes, we just kindly ask for a citation. Contact dgil@uef.fi for more details. For other types of usage contact the same email address for details.
